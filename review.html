	<details open><summary>Enter The Void</summary>
	<p> Inaccessible as mortality itself and as jolting as a bullet to the back, Gaspar Noé’s “Enter the Void,” which made its Cannes debut ten years ago this month, is a science fiction movie, but it isn’t worried about what exists outside our world. It isn’t concerned with aliens or spaceships. It’s about what we’re all obsessed with—pretending to live, refusing to die, and latching onto any ersatz empathy just for the sake of hope. It isn’t an optimistic film in its depiction of the afterlife, but that’s entirely the point—and that’s what makes it sort of beautiful.</p></details>

	<details open><summary>Memoria</summary>
	<p>There’s a point relatively early in “Memoria,” the stunning new drama from Apichatpong Weerasethakul, in which Tilda Swinton’s protagonist is trying to describe a sound that she’s been hearing in her head, leading to sleepless nights. She explains it to a technician and he presents her with an audio clip that tries to replicate it. I said out loud, “No, it’s earthier.” And then Tilda preceded to say almost exactly the same thing. I’m not trying to say I’m psychic, only that I was deeply on this film’s wavelength, and I think Weerasethakul, also known as “Joe,” would like that story. </p></details>

	<details open><summary>In the mood for love</summary>
	<p>They are in the mood for love, but not in the time and place for it. They look at each other with big damp eyes of yearning and sweetness, and go home to sleep by themselves. Adultery has sullied their lives: his wife and her husband are having an affair. "For us to do the same thing," they agree, "would mean we are no better than they are." The key word there is "agree." The fact is, they do not agree. It is simply that neither one has the courage to disagree, and time is passing. He wants to sleep with her and she wants to sleep with him, but they are both bound by the moral stand that each believes the other has taken.</p>

	<details open><summary>The Godfather</summary>
	<p>“The Godfather” is told entirely within a closed world. That’s why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.

	During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.</p></details>
